### High-Order Array Methods
    What are High order methods? They are Methods that take in another function/Method as a parameter.

### High-Order Array Methods we will be covering.

    1. forEach() - this method executes a function for each provided element in the array.
    
    2. filter() - This method creates a new array wit heach element that passes the test function

    3. map() - Calls a defined callback function on each element of an array, and returns an array that contains the results.

    4. findIndex() - Returns the index of the first element that meets the condition of the callback

    5. every() - this method tests every element in our array and if all pass our funcdtion condition it returns true

### High-Order Methods vs Forloops

    1. Readability The syntax makes the code more readable

    2. Allows the developer to clarly state their intent

    3. Each method is designed for a specific task

    4. Reduces chance of errors (Specifically off by 1 Error);

### Chaining High Order Methods / Units
    What is Chaining? - Chaining involves calling muiltiple methods on the same array/object into a singular expression.
